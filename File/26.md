# NOTE
1. in this quesiton we shuold do in space swap also 
2. we go through from 1 to end, if find changing number we put it at place x and x move next 
# SOLUTION
O(n) in space
```python
def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        x = 1 # since we do need to do with first element
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):# go through loop
            if(nums[i]!=nums[i+1]):# find the changing num
                nums[x] = nums[i+1]# place it at x 
                x+=1#move x right 
        return x
```
