# Note 
we can simply use a set to keep track of the room and do dfs

# Solution 

```python 
#dfs
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # we need a visit set to track the room 
        visit = set([0])
        # dfs 
        def dfs(room):
            for key in rooms[room]:
                if key not in visit:
                    visit.add(key)
                    dfs(key)
        dfs(0)
        return len(visit) == len(rooms)
```

```python 
# bfs 
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        visit = set([0])
        q = [0]
        while q:
            rm = q.pop(0)
            for k in rooms[rm]:
                if k not in visit:
                    visit.add(k)
                    q.append(k)
        return len(visit) == len(rooms)```
